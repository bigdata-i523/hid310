final.py is the application calculating the efficiency gap score for Indiana's legislatures. The two supporting datasets are house.csv and senate.csv. None of these files are very large and should be able to run on a personal computer with no problem.

final.tex is the corresponding paper for this project, and final.bib is its bibliography.
