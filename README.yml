        This paper addresses how big data can be used to identify food
        deserts, areas where there is no fresh, healthy food available
        to the population, to be used for community planning or
        research purposes.

        The idea of predicting car crashes used to be a fruitless
        endeavor - relegated to mere guesswork. However, advances in
        big data applications have allowed law enforcement to more
        accurately predict when and where car crashes are likely to
        occur, thus lowering first response times and taking proactive
        actions to prevent accidents in high-risk corridors. This
        paper shows several different approaches different agencies
        have taken using the power of data to solve this critical
        problem.
