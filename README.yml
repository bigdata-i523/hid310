        This paper addresses how big data can be used to identify food
        deserts, areas where there is no fresh, healthy food available
        to the population, to be used for community planning or
        research purposes.

        The idea of predicting car crashes used to be a fruitless
        endeavor - relegated to mere guesswork. However, advances in
        big data applications have allowed law enforcement to more
        accurately predict when and where car crashes are likely to
        occur, thus lowering first response times and taking proactive
        actions to prevent accidents in high-risk corridors. This
        paper shows several different approaches different agencies
        have taken using the power of data to solve this critical
        problem.

    title: Gerrymandering Detection Using Data Analysis
    abstract: >
        Can the evergreen issue of partisan gerrymandering be solved
        using data and algorithms? That question is closer to being
        solved than ever, as a method developed by University of
        Chicago researchers in 2014 is currently pending approval by
        the United States Supreme Court. We examine the method, known
        as the efficiency gap model, using data from Indiana's recent
        State Senate and House elections. We then evaluate the
        effectiveness of this model, take stock of any substantial
        critiques, and suggest courses of further research.
        and another line.
